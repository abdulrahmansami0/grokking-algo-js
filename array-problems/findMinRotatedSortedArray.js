// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

// Example 3:

// Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
// Output: 11
// Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.
