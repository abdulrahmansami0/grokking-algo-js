function variableSizeWindow(nums, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = 0;
  let windowSum = 0;

  while (right < nums.length) {
    // Expand the window by adding the element at the right pointer

    right++;
  }

  // Return the minimum window size

}

// Example usage:
const nums = [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2];
const target = 7;
console.log(variableSizeWindow(nums, target)); // Output: 2 (minimum window size is [4, 3])

function slidingWindowAlgorithm(nums) {
  // Initialization

  let end = 0; // Initialize end pointer
  let result = []; // Initialize result array or variable

  // Traversal
  while (end < nums.length) {
    // Loop until end pointer reaches the end of the array
    // Window Adjustment
    // Adjust the window boundaries as needed based on the problem requirements
    // Move the pointers to expand, shrink, or maintain the window size according to the problem logic
    // In this example, we'll move the end pointer forward
    end++;

    // Condition Checking
    // Check conditions or constraints at each step to determine if the current window meets the problem requirements
    // Perform any necessary operations or calculations based on the window contents
    // In this example, we'll perform some operation on the current window

    // Optimization
    // Optimize the algorithm by updating the solution or maintaining additional data structures as needed
    // Consider ways to optimize the algorithm's time or space complexity by minimizing redundant calculations or storing intermediate results

    // Termination
    // Continue traversing the array or string until the pointers reach the end or until the problem requirements are met
    // Terminate the loop and return the final result or solution
  }

  return result; // Return the final result or solution
}

// Example usage:
const nums2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const result = slidingWindowAlgorithm(nums2);
console.log(result); // Output: Final result or solution

// The Variable Size Window technique is widely applicable and can be used to solve various types of problems. Here are some common types of problems for which the Variable Size Window technique is frequently used:

// Minimum Size Subarray Sum:
//     Given an array of positive integers and a target sum, find the minimum size subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to the target sum.
//     Example: LeetCode Problem 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum.

// Maximum Size Subarray Sum:
//     Given an array of integers and a target sum, find the maximum size subarray whose sum is less than or equal to the target sum.
//     Example: LeetCode Problem 862. Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K.

// Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters:
//     Given a string, find the length of the longest substring containing at most K distinct characters.
//     Example: LeetCode Problem 340. Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters.

// Longest Subarray with Ones After Replacement:
//     Given an array consisting of 0s and 1s, you are allowed to replace at most one 0 with 1. Find the length of the longest subarray with all 1s.
//     Example: LeetCode Problem 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III.

// Longest Repeating Character Replacement:
//     Given a string containing only uppercase English letters, you are allowed to replace any letter with another letter. Find the length of the longest substring containing repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.
//     Example: LeetCode Problem 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement.

// Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards:
//     Given an array of integers representing the number of points on cards, choose exactly k cards from the array such that the sum of their points is maximized.
//     Example: LeetCode Problem 1423. Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards.
